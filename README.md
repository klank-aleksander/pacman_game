# Pacman Game

A classic Pacman game implemented in Java using `JTable` for rendering. The game features procedurally generated levels, a high score system, and a simple graphical interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic Level Generation** â€“ Each level is uniquely generated based on selected dimensions.
- **Customizable Level Size** â€“ Choose a width and height (10-100) before starting a game.
- **High Score System** â€“ After the game ends, the player's score is saved in a text file.
- **Simple UI** â€“ Start a new game, view high scores, or exit from the main menu.

## How to Run
1. Download the source files from the GitHub repository.
2. Compile and run the project in a Java environment.
3. The game window will appear with the options:
   - **New Game** â€“ Starts a new session.
   - **High Scores** â€“ Displays stored high scores.
   - **Exit** â€“ Closes the application.
4. In a new game, choose the level width and height, and the map will be generated dynamically.
5. The game continues until the player either loses all lives or collects all points.
6. After the game, enter your nickname to save the score.

Enjoy the game! ðŸŽ®
